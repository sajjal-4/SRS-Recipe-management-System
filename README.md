# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Recipe Management System

This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the Recipe Management System (RMS) project. The SRS outlines the complete specification, functionalities, and requirements for the system, serving as a blueprint for development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this SRS document is to:

*   Provide a detailed description of the Recipe Management System's features, functionality, and performance requirements.
*   Serve as a guide for developers during the design and implementation phases.
*   Establish a common understanding of the project requirements among stakeholders, including developers, designers, testers, and users.
*   Define the scope of the project and prevent scope creep.
*   Provide a basis for testing and validation.

## Document Structure
